Most people who use X want something short and easy to understand. While we wish we could fit everything you need to know into a post, our regulators ask us to meet our legal obligations by describing them all in a lot of detail.\nWith that in mind, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve written our Privacy Policy as simply as possible to empower you to make informed decisions when you use X by making sure you understand and have control over the information we collect, how it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s used, and when it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s shared.\u00c2\nSo if you skip reading every word of the Privacy Policy, at least know this:\n\u00c2\nX is a public platform\nLearn what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s viewable & searchable\nWe collect some data\nabout you\nLearn\u00c2\u00a0what we collect & how\nAffiliate services may have their own policies\nLearn about affiliates\nWe use your data to make X better\nLearn how we make your info work\nYou can control your experience\nLearn how to update your settings\nIf you have questions about how we use data, just ask\nLearn how to contact us\nPrivacy Policy\n1.

Information We Collect\nThe information we collect when you use X falls into three categories.\n1.1 Information you provide us.\nTo use some of our products and services you need to have an account, and to create an account, you need to provide us certain information. Likewise, if you use our paid products and services, we cannot provide them to you without getting payment information. Basically, certain information is necessary if you want to use many of our products and services.\nPersonal Accounts. If you create an account, you must provide us with some information so that we can provide our services to you. This includes a display name (for example, \u00e2\u0080\u009cCreators\u00e2\u0080\u009d); a username (for example, @XCreators); a password; an email address or phone number; a date of birth; your display language; and third-party single sign-in information (if you choose this sign-in method). You can also choose to share your location in your profile and posts, and to upload your address book to X to help find people you may know. Your profile information, which includes your display name and username, is always public, but you can use either your real name or a pseudonym. And remember, you can create multiple X accounts, for example, to express different parts of your identity, professional or otherwise.\u00c2\nProfessional Accounts. If you create a professional account, you also need to provide us with a professional category, and may provide us with other information, including street address, contact email address, and contact phone number, all of which will always be public.\u00c2\nPayment Information. In order to purchase ads or other offerings provided as part of our paid products and services you will need to provide us payment information, including your credit or debit card number, card expiration date, CVV code, and billing address.\nPreferences.\u00c2\u00a0When you set your preferences using your\u00c2\u00a0settings, we collect that information so that we can respect your preferences.\nBiometric Information. Based on your consent, we may collect and use your biometric information for safety, security, and identification purposes.\nJob Applications / Recommendations.\u00c2\u00a0We may collect and use your personal information (such as your biographical information, employment history, educational history, employment preferences, skills and abilities, and job search activity and engagement, in addition to the information we already collect as disclosed in the \u00e2\u0080\u009cInformation we collect when you use X\u00e2\u0080\u009d section of our Privacy Policy below) to recommend potential jobs to you, to share with potential employers when you apply for a job, to enable connections for professional opportunities, and to show you more relevant advertising.\n1.2 Information we collect when you use X.\nWhen you use our services, we collect information about how you use our products and services. We use that information to provide you with products and services, to help keep X more secure and respectful for everyone, and more relevant to you.\nUsage Information. We collect information about your activity on X, including:\nPosts and other content you post (including the date, application, and version of X) and information about your broadcast activity (e.g., Spaces), including broadcasts you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve created and when you created them, your lists, bookmarks, and Communities you are a part of.\nYour interactions with other users\u00e2\u0080\u0099 content, such as reposts, likes, bookmarks, shares, downloads, replies, if other users mention or tag you in content or if you mention or tag them, and broadcasts you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve participated in (including your viewing history, listening, commenting, speaking, and reacting).\nHow you interact with others on the platform, such as people you follow and people who follow you, metadata related to\u00c2\u00a0Encrypted Messages, and when you use\u00c2\u00a0Direct Messages, including the contents of the messages, the recipients, and date and time of messages.\nIf you communicate with us, such as through email, we will collect information about the communication and its content.\nWe collect information on links you interact with across our services (including in our emails sent to you).\nPurchase and payments. To allow you to make a payment or send money using X features or services, including through an intermediary, we may receive information about your transaction such as when it was made, when a subscription is set to expire or auto-renew, and amounts paid or received.\nDevice Information. We collect information from and about the devices you use to access X, including:\nInformation about your connection, such as your IP address, browser type, and related information.\nInformation about your device and its settings, such as device and advertising ID, operating system, carrier, language, memory, apps installed, and battery level.\nYour device address book, if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve chosen to share it with us.\nLocation Information. When you use X, we collect some information about your approximate location to provide the service you expect, including showing you relevant ads. You can also choose to share your current precise location or places where you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve previously used X by enabling these settings in your account.\nInferred Identity. We may collect or receive information that we use to infer your identity as detailed below:\nWhen you sign into X on a browser or device, we will associate that browser or device with your account. Subject to your settings, we may also associate your account with browsers or devices other than those you use to sign into X (or associate your signed-out device or browser with other browsers or devices or X-generated identi\u00ef\u00ac\u0081ers).\nWhen you provide other information to X, including an email address or phone number, we associate that information with your X account. Subject to your settings, we may also use this information in order to infer other information about your identity, for example by associating your account with hashes of email addresses that share common components with the email address you have provided to X.\nWhen you access X and are not signed in, we may infer your identity based on the information we collect.\nLog Information. We may receive information when you view content on or otherwise interact with our products and services, even if you have not created an account or are signed out, such as:\nIP address and related information; browser type and language; operating system; the referring webpage; access times; pages visited; location; your mobile carrier; device information (including device and application IDs); search terms and IDs (including those not submitted as queries); ads shown to you on X; X-generated identi\u00ef\u00ac\u0081ers; and identi\u00ef\u00ac\u0081ers associated with cookies. We also receive log information when you click on, view, or interact with links on our services, including when you install another application through X.\nAdvertisements. When you view or interact with ads we serve on or o\u00ef\u00ac\u0080 X, we may collect information about those views or interactions (e.g., watching a video ad or preroll, clicking on an ad, interacting with reposts of or replies to an ad).\nCookies and similar technologies. Like many websites, we use cookies and similar technologies to collect additional website usage data and to operate our services. Cookies are not required for many parts of our products and services such as searching and looking at public pro\u00ef\u00ac\u0081les. You can learn more about how we use cookies and similar technologies\u00c2\u00a0here.\nInteractions with our content on third-party sites. When you view our content on third-party websites that integrate X content, such as embedded timelines or post buttons, we may receive log information that includes the web page you visited.\n1.3 Information we receive from third parties.\nWhen you use other online products and services, they may share information about that usage with us.\nAd Partners, Developers, Publishers.\u00c2\u00a0Our ad and business partners share information with us such as browser cookie IDs, X-generated identifiers, mobile device IDs, hashed user information like email addresses, demographic or interest data, and content viewed or actions taken on a website or app. Some of our ad partners, particularly our advertisers, also enable us to collect similar information directly from their website or app by integrating our advertising technology. Information shared by ad partners and affiliates or collected by X from the websites and apps of ad partners and affiliates may be combined with the other information you share with X and that X receives, generates, or infers about you described elsewhere in this Privacy Policy.\nOther Third Parties, Account Connections, and Integrations.\u00c2\u00a0We may receive information about you from third parties who are not our ad partners, such as other X users, developers, and partners who help us evaluate the safety and quality of content on our platform, our corporate affiliates, and other services you link to your X account. You may choose to connect your X account to your account on another service, and that other service may send us information about your account on that service.\n2. How We Use Information\nBreaking down how we use the information we collect is not simple because of the way the systems that bring our services to you work. For example, the same piece of information may be used differently for different purposes to ultimately deliver a single service. We think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s most useful to describe the five main ways we use information and if you have questions that are not answered, you can always contact us. Here we go:\n2.1 Operate, improve, and personalize our services.\nWe use the information we collect to provide and operate X products and services. We also use the information we collect to improve and personalize our products and services so that you have a better experience on X, including by showing you more relevant content and ads, suggesting people and topics to follow, enabling and helping you discover affiliates, third-party apps, and services. We may use the information we collect and publicly available information to help train our machine learning or artificial intelligence models for the purposes outlined in this policy.\nWe may use the information we collect from accounts of other services that you choose to connect to your X account to provide you features like cross-posting or cross-service authentication, and to operate our services.\nWe use your contact information to help others find your account if your settings permit, including through third-party services and client applications.\nWe use your information to provide our advertising and sponsored content services subject to your settings, which helps make ads on X more relevant to you. We also use this information to measure the effectiveness of ads and to help recognize your devices to serve you ads on and off of X. Some of our ad partners also enable us to collect similar information directly from their website or app by integrating our advertising technology. Information shared by ad partners and affiliates or collected by X from the websites and apps of ad partners and affiliates may be combined with the other information you share with X and that X receives, generates, or infers about you, as described elsewhere in our Privacy Policy.\n2.2\u00c2\u00a0 Foster safety and security.\nWe use information we collect to provide for the safety and security of our users, our products, services, and your account. This includes verifying your identity, authenticating your account, and defending against fraud, unauthorized use, and illegal activity. We also use the information to evaluate and affect the safety and quality of content on X - this includes investigating and enforcing our policies and and terms, as well as applicable law.\n2.3 Measure, analyze and make our services better.\nWe use the information we collect to measure and analyze the effectiveness of our products and services and to better understand how you use them in order to make them better.\n2.4 Communicate with you about our services.\nWe use the information we collect to communicate with you about our products and services, including about product updates and changes to our policies and terms. If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re open to hearing from us, we may also send you marketing messages from time to time.\n2.5 Research.\nWe use information you share with us, or that we collect to conduct research, surveys, product testing, and troubleshooting to help us operate and improve our products and services.\n3. Sharing Information\nYou should know the ways we share your information, why we share it, and how you can control it. There are five general ways we share your information.\n3.1 When you post and share.\nWith the general public.\u00c2\u00a0You are directing us to disclose that information as broadly as possible. X content, including your profile information (e.g., name/pseudonym, username, profile pictures), is available for viewing by the general public. The public does not need to be signed in to view some content on X. They may also find X content off of X: for example, from search query results on Internet search engines or videos downloaded and reshared elsewhere (depending on your settings).\nWith other X users. Depending on your settings, and based on the X products and services you use, we share:\nYour interactions with X content of other users, such as replies, and people you follow.\nContent you send to a specific X user, such as through Direct Messages. Please keep in mind that if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve shared information like Direct Messages or protected posts with someone else who accesses X through a third-party service, the information may be shared with the third-party service.\nWith partners.\u00c2\u00a0Depending on your settings, we also provide certain third parties with information to help us offer or operate our products and services. You can learn more about these partnerships in our Help Center. You can control whether X shares your personal information with these partners by using the \u00e2\u0080\u009cData sharing with business partners\u00e2\u0080\u009d option in your Privacy & Safety settings.\u00c2\u00a0(This setting does not control sharing described elsewhere in this Privacy Policy, such as when we share information with our service providers, or through partnerships other than as described in this Help Center article.)\n3.2 With third parties & third-party integrations.\nWith service providers. We may share your information with our service providers that perform functions and provide services on our behalf, including payment services providers who facilitate payments; service providers that host our various blogs and wikis; service providers that help us understand the use of our services; applicant tracking system providers to send and receive applicant and job data to potential employers;\u00c2\u00a0and those that provide fraud detection services.\u00c2\nWith advertisers.\u00c2\u00a0Advertising revenue enables us to provide our products and services. Advertisers may learn information from your engagement with their ads on or off X. For example, if you click on an external link or ad on our services, that advertiser or website operator might figure out that you came from X, along with other information associated with the ad you clicked, such as characteristics of the audience it was intended to reach and other X-generated identifiers for that ad. They may also collect other personal information from you, such as cookie identifiers, or your IP address.\nThird-party content & integrations. We share or disclose your information with your consent or at your direction, such as when you authorize a third-party web client or application to access your account or when you direct us to share your feedback with a business. Similarly, to improve your experience, we work with third-party partners to display their video content on X or to allow cross-platform sharing. When you watch or otherwise interact with content from our video or cross-platform sharing partners, they may receive and process your personal information as described in their privacy policies. For video content, you can adjust your autoplay settings if you prefer that content not to play automatically.\nThird-party collaborators. Depending on your settings, or if you decide to share your data, we may share or disclose your information with third parties. If you do not opt out, in some instances the recipients of the information may use it for their own independent purposes in addition to those stated in X\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Privacy Policy, including, for example, to train their artificial intelligence models, whether generative or otherwise.\u00c2\nThrough our APIs. We use technology like APIs and embeds to make public X information available to websites, apps, and others for their use, for example, displaying posts on a news website or analyzing what people say on X. We generally make this content available in limited quantities for free and charge licensing fees for large-scale access. We have standard terms that govern how this information can be used, and a compliance program to enforce these terms. But these individuals and companies are not affiliated with X, and their offerings may not reflect updates you make on X. For more information about how we make public data on X available to the world, visit https://developer.x.com.\n3.3 When required by law, to prevent harm, or in the public interest.\nWe may preserve, use, share, or disclose your information if we believe that it is reasonably necessary to:\ncomply with a law, regulation, legal process, or governmental request;\nprotect the safety of any person, protect the safety or integrity of our platform, including to help prevent spam, abuse, or malicious actors on our services;\nexplain why we have removed content or accounts from our services (e.g., for a violation of\u00c2\u00a0our Rules);\naddress fraud, security, or technical issues; or\nprotect our rights or property, or the rights or property of those who use our services.\nWe may also use different signals and your data to infer, preserve, use, share, or disclose your age and identity information in order to comply with regulatory requirements as well as for safety, security, fraud, know-your-customer, know-your-business, and identity verification, as the case may be. We may also share or disclose your age and identity information with our partners, service providers, and others for these purposes.\n3.4 With our Affiliates.\nWe may share information amongst our affiliates to provide our products and services.\n3.5 As a result of a change in ownership.\nWe may share, sell, or transfer information about you in connection with a merger, acquisition, reorganization, sale of assets, or bankruptcy. This Privacy Policy will apply to your personal information that is shared with (before and after the close of any transaction) or transferred to the new entity.\n4. How Long We Keep Information\nWe keep different types of information for different periods of time, depending on how long we need to retain it in order to provide you with our products and services, to comply with our legal requirements and for safety and security reasons. For example:\nWe keep your profile information, such as your display name, user name, password and email address for the duration of your account. We cannot provide you with our products and services without retaining this information.\nWe keep your usage information, such as the content you post, your interactions with other users\u00e2\u0080\u0099 content and how you interact with others on the platform for the duration of your account or until such content is removed.\nWe keep your payment information, including your credit or debit card number and billing address for the duration you use our paid products and services. Records of transactions will be kept for longer, in accordance with applicable law.\nIf you communicate with us, such as through email, we will keep information about the communication and its content for up to 18 months, unless it is necessary for us to retain it for a longer period to comply with our legal obligations or to exercise or defend our legal rights.\nWe generally collect device information, location information, inferred identity information and log information using cookies. We keep cookies and information collected using cookies for up to 13 months. You can learn more about how we use cookies and similar technologies here.\nWe keep information about your views or interactions with ads on or off X, as well as how you interact with our content on third-party sites for up to 90 days.\u00c2\nWe keep information shared by ad and business partners for up to 90 days.\nWhere you violate our Rules and your account is suspended, we may keep the identifiers you used to create the account (such as your email address or phone number) indefinitely to prevent repeat policy offenders from creating new accounts.\nWe may need to keep certain information longer than our policies specify in order to comply with legal requirements and for safety and security reasons. For example:\nTo comply with a law, regulation, legal process or governmental request. Including in order to adhere to a legally appropriate preservation request made by law enforcement. You can read more about law enforcement access here.\nIn connection with legal claims, litigation and regulatory matters. Including where it is reasonably necessary to retain information relating to your account in order to defend X against legal claims.\nTo maintain the safety and security of our products and services. Including where it is necessary to store your information longer in order to investigate and fight abuse on our products and services.\nRemember public content can exist elsewhere even after it is removed from X. For example, search engines and other third parties may retain copies of your posts longer, based upon their own privacy policies, even after they are deleted or expire on X. You can read more about search visibility here.\n5. Take Control\n5.1 Access, Correction, Portability.\nYou can access, correct, or modify the information you provided to us by editing your profile and adjusting your account settings.\nYou can learn more about the information we have collected or inferred about you in Your X Data and request access to additional information here.\nYou can download a copy of your information, such as your posts, by following the instructions here.\nTo protect your privacy and maintain security, we take steps to verify your identity before granting you access to your personal information or complying with a deletion, portability, or other related request. We may, in certain situations, reject your request for access, correction, or portability, for example, we may reject access where you are unable to verify your identity.\n5.2 Deleting your Information.\nIf you follow the instructions here, your account will be deactivated and your data will be queued for deletion. When deactivated, your X account, including your display name, username, and public profile, will no longer be viewable on X.com, X for iOS, and X for Android. For up to 30 days after deactivation it is still possible to restore your X account if it was accidentally or wrongfully deactivated.\n5.3 Objecting to, Restricting, or Withdrawing your Consent.\nYou can manage your privacy settings and other account features here. If you change your settings it may take some time for your choices to be fully reflected throughout our systems. You may also notice changes in your X experience or limitations in your ability to access certain features depending on the settings you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve adjusted.\u00c2\u00a0You may also manage additional settings when interacting with certain content and features on different parts of the platform, such as whether a Space is recorded, or whether videos you upload are downloadable by others.\n5.4 Authorized Agent Requests.\nTo submit a request related to access, modification, or deletion of your information, or someone else\u00e2\u0080\u0099s information if you are their authorized agent, you may also contact us as specified in the How To Contact X section of our Privacy Policy below. We may require you to provide additional information for verification.\n6. Your Rights and Ours\nWe provide X to people all over the world and provide many of the same privacy tools and controls to all of our users regardless of where they live. However, your experience may be slightly different than users in other countries to ensure X respects local requirements.\n6.1 We have specific legal bases to use your information.\nX has carefully considered the legal reasons it is permitted to collect, use, share and otherwise process your information. If you want to dig in to learn more and better understand the nuances, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099d encourage you to check out this additional information about data processing. And no, we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t sell your personal information.\u00c2\n6.2 We move your data to make X work for you.\nJust as you use X to seamlessly participate in global conversations with people in countries all over the world, X must move information across borders and to different countries around the world to support the safe and reliable service you depend on. For example, if you live in Europe and are having a conversation with someone in the United States, information has to move between those countries to provide that experience \u00e2\u0080\u0093 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what you expect from us.\nWe also use data centers and cloud providers, and engage our affiliates and third-party partners and service providers located in many parts of the world to help us provide our services. Before we move data between countries we look at the risks that may be presented to the data and rely on standard contractual clauses (SCCs), where applicable, to ensure your data rights are protected. To request a copy of the SCCs, please contact us here. If data will be shared with a third party, we require them to maintain the same protections over your data that we provide directly.\nX is a participant in the EU-US Data Privacy Framework (DPF), the Swiss-US DPF and the UK Extension to the EU-US DPF. X complies with the DPF Principles for all its processing of personal data received from the European Union, Switzerland and the UK, in reliance on the EU-US DPF, Swiss-US DPF and UK Extension to the EU-US DPF, respectively. If you have an inquiry or complaint related to our participation in the DPF, please contact us here. As part of our participation in the DPF, if you have a dispute with us about our adherence to the DPF Principles, we will seek to resolve it through our internal complaint resolution process, alternatively through the US-based independent dispute resolution body JAMS, and under certain conditions, through the DPF Arbitration Process following the procedures and subject to the conditions described in Annex 1\u00c2\u00a0to the DPF Principles. DPF participants are subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the US Federal Trade Commission and other authorized statutory bodies. Under certain circumstances, participants may be liable for the transfer of personal data from the EU, Switzerland and the UK to third parties outside the EU, Switzerland and the UK. Learn more about the EU-US DPF, the Swiss-US DPF and the UK Extension to the EU-US DPF\u00c2\u00a0here.\n7.

You must also be old enough to consent to the processing of your personal data in your country (in some countries we may allow your parent or guardian to do so on your behalf). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you become aware that your child has provided us with personal information without your consent, please contact us here.

General\nThe X Privacy Policy is written in English but is made available in multiple languages through translations. X strives to make the translations as accurate as possible to the original English version.

The information Google collects, and how that information is used, depends on how you use our services and how you manage your privacy controls.When you\u2019re not signed in to a Google Account, we store the information we collect with unique identifiers tied to the browser, application, or device you\u2019re using. This allows us to do things like maintain your preferences across browsing sessions, such as your preferred language or whether to show you more relevant search results or ads based on your activity.When you\u2019re signed in, we also collect information that we store with your Google Account, which we treat as personal information.Things you create or provide to usWhen you create a Google Account, you provide us with personal information that includes your name and a password.

And if your Web & App Activity setting is enabled, your searches and other activity from Google services, which may also include location information, is saved to your Google Account. Learn more about how we use location information.In some circumstances, Google also collects information about you from publicly accessible sources. For example, if your name appears in your local newspaper, Google\u2019s Search engine may index that article and display it to other people if they search for your name. We may also collect information about you from trusted partners, such as directory services who provide us with business information to be displayed on Google\u2019s services, marketing partners who provide us with information about potential customers of our business services, and security partners who provide us with information to protect against abuse.

For example, Security Checkup provides security tips adapted to how you use Google products. And, depending on your available settings, Google Play could use information like apps you\u2019ve already installed and videos you\u2019ve watched on YouTube to suggest new apps you might like.Depending on your settings, we may also show you personalized ads based on your interests and activity across Google services. For example, if you search for \u201cmountain bikes,\u201d you may see ads for sports equipment on YouTube. You can control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your ad settings in\nMy Ad Center.We don\u2019t show you personalized ads based on sensitive categories, such as race, religion, sexual orientation, or health.We don\u2019t show you personalized ads based on your content from Drive, Gmail, or Photos.We don\u2019t share information that personally identifies you with advertisers, such as your name or email, unless you ask us to.

We use a variety of tools to do this, including Google Analytics.

For example, we may send you a notification if we detect suspicious activity, like an attempt to sign in to your Google Account from an unusual location. Or we may let you know about upcoming changes or improvements to our services. And if you contact Google, we\u2019ll keep a record of your request in order to help solve any issues you might be facing.Protect Google, our users, and the publicWe use information to help improve the safety and reliability of our services. This includes detecting, preventing, and responding to fraud, abuse, security risks, and technical issues that could harm Google, our users, or the public.We use different technologies to process your information for these purposes. We use automated systems that analyze your content to provide you with things like customized search results, personalized ads, or other features tailored to how you use our services. And we analyze your content to help us detect abuse such as spam, malware, and illegal content. We also use algorithms to recognize patterns in data. For example, Google Translate helps people communicate across languages by detecting common language patterns in phrases you ask it to translate.We may use the information we collect across our services and across your devices for the purposes described above. For example, depending on your available settings, if you watch videos of guitar players on YouTube, you might see an ad for guitar lessons on a site that uses our ad products.
