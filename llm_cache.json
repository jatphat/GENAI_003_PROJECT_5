You can exercise your rights and change your preferences anytime.BackgroundData Subject Rights RequestsDepending on your location (the jurisdiction in which you are a resident), you may have different data subject rights available to you. These may include requests for access, erasure, rectification/correction, to opt out of receiving marketing emails or texts, object to our use of your email address or phone number for advertising, etc. To submit a Data Subject Rights requests for your jurisdiction, click\u00c2\u00a0here.You can also tell us to stop sending you email and text messages by following the opt-out instructions sent with these communications. Please be aware that we may need to keep certain information to honor your choices (e.g., if you tell us to stop sending marketing emails, we will need your email address on file so that our systems remember that you no longer wish to receive marketing communications to that email address).Also, there are some situations where we may be unable to grant your request (e.g., deleting transaction data where we have a legal obligation to keep it, or for fraud prevention, security, or to protect the privacy of others, or for the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims, among other things).\u00c2\u00a0BackgroundTraditional Online Behavioral AdvertisingBackgroundHow you exercise choice as to interest-based adsAdvertising Industry Opt-OutsFor the U.S., to exercise choice with respect to interest-based advertising, you can utilize the opt-out mechanism provided by the Digital Advertising Alliance (\u00e2\u0080\u009cDAA\u00e2\u0080\u009d) by\u00c2\u00a0clicking here (for browsers) or here (for app-based opt-outs).The Network Advertising Initiative (\u00e2\u0080\u009cNAI\u00e2\u0080\u009d) has developed a tool that allows consumers to opt out of certain Interest-based Ads delivered by NAI members' ad networks. To learn more about opting out of such targeted advertising or to use the NAI tool, see http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/. For Europe, you may click\u00c2\u00a0here to learn more about the DAA-Europe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s opt-out program. For Canada, you may click here to learn more about the DAA Canada\u00e2\u0080\u0099s opt-out program. To opt-out of Unified ID 2.0 globally click here.Online Platform Opt-OutsP&G may share identifiers connected to you, such as a hashed version of your email address, with online platforms, including but not limited to those listed below, for the purpose of sending you interest-based advertising. To learn more about how these platforms may use your data and about how you can control the use of this data, please follow the links below.GoogleMetaMicrosoft / BingPinterestRedditSnapTikTokPlease be aware that, even if you opt-out of certain kinds of interest-based ads, you may continue to receive other ads. Further, opting out of one or more NAI or DAA members only means that those selected members should no longer under the DAA / NAI rules deliver certain targeted ads to you. This will affect services provided by the applicable DAA / NAI members but does not mean you will no longer receive any targeted content and/or ads from non-participating parties. Also, if your browsers are configured to reject cookies when you visit the opt-out page, or you subsequently erase your cookies, use a different Device or web browser(s), or use a non-browser-based method of access, your DAA / NAI browser-based opt-out may not, or may no longer, be effective. Mobile device opt-outs will not affect browser-based Interest-based ads even on the same device, and you must opt-out separately for each device. We are not responsible for the effectiveness of, or compliance with, any third party opt-out options or programs or the accuracy of their statements regarding their programs.You can also prevent or reduce getting interest-based ads on websites by declining cookies in your browser(s), or on mobile devices by declining the \u00e2\u0080\u009caccess to data\u00e2\u0080\u009d requests that apps usually present when you install them or by adjusting the ad tracking settings on your device. Please note that you may also receive personalized ads based on your email address or phone number, if you have provided those to us for marketing purposes. To opt out of that usage, please contact us here (Note: Please ensure you select the correct location / country of your residence by clicking the button in the top left corner).You will still see \u00e2\u0080\u009ccontextual\u00e2\u0080\u009d ads even if you opt out of interest-based ads.\u00c2\u00a0Even if we stop sending you interest-based ads, you will still get ads from our brands on your computer or mobile devices. These ads, however, are based on the context of the sites you visit and are called contextual ads. Unlike interest-based ads which are based on pages you visit on your mobile phone or computer viewing activities over time and across unrelated services, contextual ads are ads shown to you based on the context of the specific site you are visiting. For example, you still may see an ad for one of our baby care brands while looking at nursery products online because these sites traditionally have had mostly new or expecting parents as visitors. You should also know that we may still collect information from your computer or devices and use it for other purposes like evaluating how our websites work, for consumer research, or detecting fraud, pursuant to applicable laws. BackgroundHow You Can Control CookiesYou can set your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent to your computer. However, this may prevent our sites or services from working properly. You can also set your browser to delete cookies every time you finish browsing.When you opt-out of interest-based advertising, an opt-out cookie is sent to your browser that indicates that you no longer want to receive interest-based ads. Your opt-out cookie will be deleted if you decide to delete\u00c2\u00a0all\u00c2\u00a0cookies on your browser. This means that you will need to opt-out again on each browser where you have deleted cookies if you still do not want to receive interest-based ads.In some markets and on some of our websites, we offer a cookie consent management platform which allows you to exercise choice with respect to certain categories of cookies. If this is available, this may appear as a cookie banner and/or as an icon that is visible on the applicable websites. We may also provide similar technology in mobile apps, which, if available, will be accessible through the applicable app\u00e2\u0080\u0099s settings menu.BackgroundU.S. State Privacy LawsSee our \u00e2\u0080\u009cU.S. State Privacy Notice \u00e2\u0080\u009c below for information required by certain state privacy laws, and information regarding privacy rights under such laws.BackgroundAdditional Information for EEA, Switzerland, UK and Serbia ResidentsIf you live in the EEA, Switzerland, the UK or Serbia, or are physically in the EEA, Switzerland, Serbia or the UK, you may access the personal data we hold about you, request that inaccurate, outdated, or no longer necessary information be corrected, erased, or restricted, and ask us to provide your data in a format that allows you to transfer it to another service provider. You also may withdraw your consent at any time where we are relying on your consent for the processing of your personal data. And you may object to our processing of your personal data (this means ask us to stop using it) where that processing is based on our legitimate interest (this means we have a legitimate reason for using the data for a certain purpose and this reason is not outweighed by your interest in P&G not using it). To make a request, please contact us.

We do this respectfully and carefully to protect your rights. Personal data can help us better understand your interests and preferences as a consumer and a person.BackgroundHow We Collect Personal DataWe collect personal data about you in many ways and from many places. Some of the personal data we collect may include personal data that can be used to identify you; for example, your name, email address, telephone number, or postal address. In some jurisdictions, things like IP address or cookie and mobile device identifiers may also be considered personal data. Some of the personal data we collect may be considered sensitive personal data or special category data and may include, account login information, financial information, precise geolocation data, government identifiers, racial or ethnic origin, mental & physical health / condition, Consumer Health Data, sex life or sexual orientation, transgender / non binary status, children\u00e2\u0080\u0099s data, criminal background, genetic data and biometric data for the purpose of uniquely identifying an individual etc. BackgroundYou Share it DirectlyYou give us your personal data directly for example when signing up for an account on our websites or mobile apps or by calling or emailing us, or while participating in a P&G survey or contest etc. We may ask for things like your name, email or home address, date of birth, payment information, your age, gender, the number of people in your family, and the way you want us to send you information about our products and services\u00e2\u0080\u0094for example, to your home address, email address, or by texting you.BackgroundYou Interact with Websites & EmailsWe may use technologies that automatically collect information when you visit our sites, view our advertisements, or use our products or services. For example, we use cookies (a tiny file stored on your computer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s browser) to tell us what browser and operating system you are using, your IP address, and about your online activities such as web pages you visit, links you click, or whether you have or have not opened an email from us.BackgroundYou Use Mobile Apps & Other DevicesTo give you the best possible user experience, we may use technologies that collect information from your phone when you use our mobile apps or our \u00e2\u0080\u009csmart\u00e2\u0080\u009d devices in your home. You consent to this when downloading the app or installing household internet connected devices. This information could include your mobile phone or other device advertising ID, information about your phone\u00e2\u0080\u0099s operating system, how you use the app or device, your physical location, and other information that is considered personal data in some jurisdictions. You will get a pop-up notice on your phone or device that gives you the option to accept or reject allowing us to know your precise geolocation (exactly where you are standing or where you are accessing the internet) or to collect or access other personal data, as required by the applicable laws.BackgroundYou Connect with Partners or Third PartiesWe may get information that other companies share with or sell to us. For example, you may have given consent for another company to share your personal data with us when you signed up for telecom services or a retailer loyalty points program. Where possible, we may also collect personal data from publicly available sources, such as from internet postings, blog entries, videos, or social media sites. We may also receive personal data from other companies, such as consumer data resellers, who are in the business of collecting or aggregating information about you sourced from publicly available databases (in line with local legal requirements as applicable) or from consent you have given to their use and subsequently our use of your personal data. This might include information about your income level, age, gender, number of people in your family, and products you have bought on the internet or from stores in your neighborhood.BackgroundGeneral Ways We Use Personal DataWe use your personal data to help us meet our purpose of touching and improving the lives of people like you every day around the world. For example, we use your information for the following Processing Purposes:Products/Services. This includes performing services for you and sending you products or samples you have requested.Customer Management. This includes:Identifying and authenticating you to our different marketing programs and websitesAdministering and maintaining accounts and preferences, as well as financial incentive, rewards, discounts (e.g., price or service coupons) and loyalty programs (collectively, \u00e2\u0080\u009cRewards Programs\u00e2\u0080\u009d)Helping you manage your P&G site or app preferencesAllowing you to enter our contests or sweepstakes and leaving ratings and reviewsCustomer Service/Communications, such as:Responding to your questions or requests for informationProviding customer serviceSending transactional messages (such as account statements or confirmations)Interacting with you on social mediaSending marketing communications about our products or services (or the products or services of our partners), survey, and invitationsPayment/Financial, such as:Processing your payment for the products you buy from usProcessing and issuing refunds and collections Serving Ads. This includes serving you with relevant ads and serving others, who, having a profile like yours, may be interested in hearing from us, with relevant ads through custom audiences and look-alike audiences. For example, we may upload your hashed email address into a social media service and ask that social media service to send our ads to you and to people who have similar interests as you, including in other countries, based on data it has about you and about other people Ads Administration, such as measuring and tracking the effectiveness of advertising campaigns and carry out other administrative and accounting activities with respect to ad campaigns Quality and Safety, including:Quality control, training, and analyticsSafety maintenance and verificationSystem administration and technology management, including optimizing our websites and applicationsSecurity, including detecting threats and protecting against malicious or fraudulent activityRecordkeeping and Auditing, including recordkeeping and auditing interactions with consumers, including logs and records maintained as part of transaction informationLegal/Compliance, including risk management, audit, investigations, reporting and other legal and compliance reasons. Research & Development (\u00e2\u0080\u009cR&D\u00e2\u0080\u009d), such as Internal research To design and develop products, services and programs that delight our consumersPurposes Disclosed at Collection when you provide your personal dataLegitimate Business Purposes that are compatible with the purpose of collecting your personal data and that are not prohibited by lawBackgroundHow We Use CookiesCookies are small files sent to your computer as you surf the web. They store useful information about how you interact with the websites you visit. You can learn more about how to control cookies here.We use cookies in several ways, such as:to allow you to browse the website and use its featuresto serve you with relevant advertising and measure the effectiveness of such advertisingto ensure that you are not shown an ad more than you should be (called \u00e2\u0080\u009cfrequency capping\u00e2\u0080\u009d)to learn more about the way you interact with P&G contentto help us improve your experience when visiting our websitesto remember your preferences, such as a language or a region, so there is no need for you to customize the website on each visitto identify errors and resolve themto analyze how well our websites are performingBackgroundTypes of Cookies We UseStrictly Necessary Cookies: \u00c2\u00a0These cookies (also sometimes referred to as \u00e2\u0080\u009cessential\u00e2\u0080\u009d) allow the page to load or provide some essential functionality without which the page would not work (i.e., store your data in a shopping cart).Functional Cookies: \u00c2\u00a0These cookies allow sites to remember what you prefer when you come back again. For example, if you choose to read the site in French on your first visit, the next time you come back the site will appear automatically in French. Not having to select a language preference every time makes it more convenient, more efficient, and user-friendly for you.Advertising / Targeting Cookies: These cookies can be used to learn about what interests you generally might have, based, for example, on the websites you visit and the products you buy. That data allows us to send you ads for products and services that better fit the things you like or need. It also allows us to limit the number of times you see the same advertisement.Analytics / Performance Cookies: These cookies tell us how you use our websites, like which pages you visited and which links you clicked. This helps us measure and improve the performance of our websites. We use different analytics cookies in different jurisdictions. In many cases, we use Google Analytics cookies to monitor the performance of our sites. Our ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics about your visits to our sites is restricted by the Google Analytics Terms of Use and the Google Privacy Policy.Social Media Cookies: These cookies, that are set by a range of social media services that we have added to the site, allow you to share our content with your friends and networks and enable us to reach you with ads on those social platforms related to your visits on our sites. The cookies of some social media sites, e.g., Facebook, are also used for ad targeting.BackgroundInterest-Based AdvertisingWhen you visit our partner sites, we can show you ads or other content we believe you would like to see. For example, you may receive advertisements for Tide\u00c2\u00ae laundry detergent if we notice that you are visiting sites that sell children\u00e2\u0080\u0099s clothing or school supplies. And from that information we may conclude that you have children and therefore could well be interested in a powerful laundry-cleaning product. In this way, we intend to send you relevant information about our products that might be of benefit to you. To learn more about your choices regarding interest-based advertising go here.We Learn from Groups of Consumers Sharing Similar Interests: \u00c2\u00a0We may place you into a particular group of consumers who show the same interests. For example, we may put you in the group of \u00e2\u0080\u009crazor aficionados\u00e2\u0080\u009d if we see you frequently purchase razors online or you could be a \u00e2\u0080\u009cbargain-shopper\u00e2\u0080\u009d if we notice you use online coupons or look for discounts or sales. We may infer these things about you based on your activity on certain web pages, links you click on our websites and other websites you visit, mobile applications you use, or our brand emails you view and links you click in the emails, as well based on other information we have collected, such as from retailer partners and other third parties. We group together cookie and device IDs to help us learn about general trends, habits, or characteristics from a group of consumers who all act similarly online and/or offline. By doing this, we can find and serve many others who \u00e2\u0080\u009clook like\u00e2\u0080\u009d those already in the group and thereby send them what we believe will be relevant and beneficial product offers and information.We Link Other Information to Your Cookie and Device IDs: \u00c2\u00a0Your cookie and device IDs may be supplemented with other information, such as information about the products you buy offline or information that you provide directly to us when creating an account on our sites. We generally do this in ways that will not directly personally identify you. For example, we could know that cookie ID ABC12345 belongs to the razor aficionado group based on a person\u00e2\u0080\u0099s web site visits, age, gender, and shopping habits. Should we want to personally identify your cookie or device information (web and app viewing history), we will do so in accordance with applicable laws.We May Know You Across Your Computers, Tablets, Phones and Devices: \u00c2\u00a0We may know that cookie ID ABC12345 is from a computer that that may be connected to the same person or household owning the mobile phone with device ID EFG15647. This means that you may search for diapers on your laptop, click on a Google search result link which we have sponsored, and then later see an ad for our Pampers\u00c2\u00ae brand diapers on your mobile phone. We might assume or deduce that the same person owns the computer and phone because, for example, they sign on to the same Wi-Fi network every day at the same time. Understanding what devices seem to be used by a person or household helps us limit the number of times you see the same ad across your devices. And this is important because that way you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get annoyed at us for spamming you with the same ad and we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t pay for such repetitive ads that we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want you to receive.Addressable Media: When you provide us with your personal data via our sites or apps, we may use an encryption of that data \u00e2\u0080\u0093 or a substitute identifier such as The Trade Desk's UID2 -- to serve you with ads we think you may like. We do this generally by uploading a pseudonymized version (replaced with artificial letters or numbers) of your email address, phone number, or your mobile advertising ID to a platform that offers ad space (e.g., Facebook, YouTube, Instagram, TikTok, etc.). We also use that same data to serve you advertising through what is called the open web. This means you may see relevant ads from us on sites like nytimes.com or apps or other places like digital TV that participate in online auctions of their ad inventory.Advanced Matching: Some of our sites use the Advanced Matching features offered by Social Media Platforms to its advertisers (e.g. Facebook\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Advanced Matching, TikTok\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Advanced Matching, etc.). Through Advanced Matching, we may send some of the personal data you enter on our site form fields (e.g., your name, email address, and phone number \u00e2\u0080\u0093 not any sensitive personal data or special category data) in a pseudonymized format to the Social Media Platform, or the Social Media Platform Pixel will pseudonymize and pull that data automatically, for the purpose of helping associate you with your browser cookie or device ID. We do this so that we can better target and measure the effectiveness of our advertising on the respective Social Media platforms. This is how we can know that if we showed you an ad on a given Social Media Platform, you clicked on it, came to our site and bought something \u00e2\u0080\u0093 or not \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and therefore whether we should continue to buy ads on that Social Media Platform \u00e2\u0080\u0093 or not.Google Analytics Advertising Features: Some of our sites use Google Remarketing Lists for Search Ads with Analytics (\u00e2\u0080\u009cRLSA\u00e2\u0080\u009d), which is a service they offer to advertisers. When individuals visit our sites, Google Analytics collects data about their visits (and not any sensitive personal data or special category data). If a visitor is signed into their Google account, we are able to provide that user with interest-based advertising when they conduct a Google search for terms related to the P&G site they visited. For example, if you are signed into a Google account when visiting our Head & Shoulders website, we may provide you with Head & Shoulders advertising when you search for \u00e2\u0080\u009cdandruff shampoo\u00e2\u0080\u009d on Google. Our ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics about your visits to our sites is restricted by the Google Analytics Terms of Use and the Google Privacy Policy. To understand how Google uses data when you use our partners' sites or apps, visit here. You may opt out of Google Analytics at any time.BackgroundOther Technologies We May UseProximity-Based Beacons: \u00c2\u00a0Beacons send one-way signals to mobile apps you install on your phone over very short distances to tell you, for example, what products are on-sale as you walk through a store. Beacons only talk to your device when you get close enough and after you have given consent within the mobile application associated with a particular beacon. In turn, apps may provide us location information to help customize advertising and offers to you. For example, when you are near a beacon in the skin care section of a supermarket, we may send you a $4 off coupon.Pixels: These are small objects embedded into a web page but are not visible. They are also known as \"tags,\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cweb bugs,\u00e2\u0080\u009d or \"pixel gifs.\" We may use pixels to deliver cookies to your computer, monitor our website activity, make logging into our sites easier, and for online marketing activities. We may also include pixels in our promotional email messages or newsletters to determine whether you open them and click on their links. This helps us understand whether you are an active user (which will prevent your data from being deleted due to inactivity). It also helps us measure the effectiveness of our marketing efforts, and derive insights and analysis, that we will use to personalize the content of our communication and to guide our marketing decisions (for example, if you opened an email but did not click on the links in it, we may decide to retarget you on Facebook).Mobile Device Identifiers and SDKs: \u00c2\u00a0We use software code in our mobile apps to collect information as you use our apps which is like what cookies collect on our websites. This will be information like your mobile phone identifiers (iOS IDFAs and Android Advertising IDs) and the way you use our apps.Precise Geolocation: \u00c2\u00a0We may receive information about your exact location from things like global positioning system (GPS) coordinates (longitude and latitude) when you use our mobile apps. You will always get a pop-up notice on your phone or device asking for you to accept or reject allowing us to know exactly where you are in the world. You should understand that we will not always ask for consent to know generally that you are in a broader city, postal code, or province. For example, we do not consider it to be precise location if all we know is that you are somewhere in Manila, Philippines.BackgroundSite and App ContentPlugins: \u00c2\u00a0Our websites may include plugins from other companies such as social networks. An example of a plugin is the Facebook \u00e2\u0080\u009cLike\u00e2\u0080\u009d button. These plugins may collect information (e.g., the URL of the page you visited) and send it back to the company that created them. This may happen even if you do not click on the plugin. These plugins are governed by the privacy policy and terms of the company that created them, even though they appear on our sites. Logins: \u00c2\u00a0Our websites may allow you to log in using your account with another company such as, for example, \u00e2\u0080\u009cLogin with Facebook.\u00e2\u0080\u009d When you do this, we will have access only to the information that you have given us consent to receive from your account settings in the other company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s account you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re using to log in with.User Content: \u00c2\u00a0Some of our sites and apps will allow you to upload your own content for contests, blogs, videos, and other functions. Please remember that any information you submit or post becomes public information. We do not have control over how others may use the content you submit to our sites and apps. We are not responsible for such uses in ways that may violate this privacy policy, the law, or your personal privacy and safety.Links: \u00c2\u00a0P&G sites may include links to other sites, which we do not control. Those sites will be governed by their own privacy policies and terms, not ours.BackgroundAutomated Decision-Making and ProfilingAutomated decision-making implies making a decision using automated means without human involvement. Profiling is a form of automated processing of personal data consisting of the use of personal data to evaluate certain personal characteristics of an individual for the purpose of analyzing or predicting, for example, that individual\u00e2\u0080\u0099s personal preferences, interests, likely behavior, etc.As you have read in this Privacy Policy, we collect a variety of types of personal data both from you and from other commercially available sources. This data may be combined and analyzed, including sometimes using algorithms, to identify links between certain behaviors and personal characteristics. P&G users who have similar characteristics or have performed similar actions are likely to share similar interests in our products: based on this analysis, segments of P&G consumers are created and targeted accordingly with relevant offers via email, online advertising, and social media.This process allows us to customize our communications to your declared or inferred interests. However, we will not conduct any automated decision-making processes, including profiling, that can produce legal effects or that can similarly significantly affect your rights and freedoms, as per Art. 22(1) and (4) of the GDPR and, should we want to engage in more intrusive profiling and tracking practices, we will always inform you and, where legally required, ask for your consent before doing so or provide you with the right to opt-out.How We Disclose Personal DataplusBackgroundWith Your ConsentWhen we have your consent, we may disclose your personal data to others, such as select partners so they can send you offers, promotions, or ads about products or services we believe you may be interested in.

As a multinational company, P&G undertakes data transfers, either within the P&G group of entities, or when sharing your data with service providers or selected partners that may store, process, or access your data in a country other than the one in which it was collected, including the United States. Personal data collected from Quebec, for example, may be transferred outside of Canada with adequate protections and safeguards in place.As far as EU citizens are concerned, (but also citizens of Switzerland, UK and Serbia for example) this means that their data may be processed outside of the European Economic Area (EEA), either in countries that have been recognized by the European Commission to offer adequate data protection, like the United Kingdom (from where, for example, some of our fulfillment, return and contact center services are managed for the EU region), or Switzerland (where our EU headquarters are located), or in other countries that are not deemed, by the European Commission, as offering such level of data protection. For such transfers of data, because special safeguards need to be foreseen to ensure that the protection travels with the data, we use the EU Standard Contractual Clauses, standardized and pre-approved model data protection clauses.

For residents of states without Consumer privacy rights, we will consider requests but will apply our discretion in how we process such requests. For states that have passed consumer privacy laws, but are not yet in effect, we will also consider applying state law rights prior to the effective date of such laws but will do so in our discretion.BackgroundMaking a Request and Scope of RequestsAs permitted by the U.S. Privacy Laws, certain requests you submit to us are subject to an identity verification process (\u00e2\u0080\u009cVerifiable Consumer Request\u00e2\u0080\u009d) as described below in the \u00e2\u0080\u009cVerifying Your Request\u00e2\u0080\u009d section below. We will not fulfill such requests unless you have provided sufficient information for us to reasonably verify you are the Consumer about whom we collected personal information. To make a request, please submit your request to us by one of the methods below. For further instructions on how to submit a Do Not Sell/Share/Target request, for non-cookie PI (as defined below), please go to the \u00e2\u0080\u009cDo Not Sell/Share/Target\u00e2\u0080\u009d section below.Calling us at (877) 701-0404\u00c2\u00a0Visiting our Preference Center (which can be reached by the \u00e2\u0080\u009cYour Privacy Choices\u00e2\u0080\u009d link in the footer of our websites or via the Settings menu in our mobile applications) Some personal data we maintain about you is not sufficiently associated with enough of your other personal data for us to be able to verify that it is your particular personal data (e.g., clickstream data tied only to a pseudonymous browser ID). We do not include that personal data in response to those requests. If we deny a verified request, we will explain the reasons in our response. You are not required to create a password-protected account with us to make a Verifiable Consumer Request. We will use personal data provided in a Verifiable Consumer Request only to verify your identity or authority to make the request and to track and document request responses unless you also gave it to us for another purpose.We will make commercially reasonable efforts to identify personal data that we collect, process, store, disclose, and otherwise use and to respond to your privacy requests. We will typically not charge a fee to fully respond to your requests; provided, however, we may refuse to act upon a request, if your request is excessive, repetitive, unfounded, or overly burdensome. If we determine that we may refuse a request, we will give you notice explaining why we made that decision.BackgroundVerifying Your RequestTo help protect your privacy and maintain security, we take steps to verify your identity before granting you access to your personal data or considering your deletion request. Upon receipt of your request, we will send you a verification form by email or postal mail. To complete your request, please respond to the verification form when you receive it. To verify your identity, we may require you to provide any of the following information: Name, email address, postal address, or date of birth. We will review the information provided as part of your request and may ask you to provide additional information via e-mail or other means as part of this verification process. We will not fulfill your Right to Know (Categories), Right to Know (Specific Pieces/Portability), Right to Delete, or Right to Correction request unless you have provided sufficient information for us to reasonably verify you are the Consumer about whom we collected personal data. The same verification process does not apply to opt-outs of Sale or Sharing, or limitation of sensitive personal data or special category data requests, but we may apply some verification measures if we suspect fraud. The verification standards we are required to apply for each type of request vary. We verify your categories requests and certain deletion and correction requests (e.g., those that are less sensitive in nature) to a reasonable degree of certainty, which may include matching at least two data points provided by you with data points maintained by us, which we have determined to be reliable for the purpose of verifying you. For certain deletion and correction requests (such as those that relate to personal data that is more sensitive in nature) and for specific pieces requests, we apply a verification standard of reasonably high degree of certainty. This standard includes matching at least three data points provided by you with data points maintained by us, which we have determined to be reliable for the purpose of verifying you, and may include obtaining a signed declaration from you, under penalty of perjury, that you are the individual whose personal data is the subject of the request. If we cannot verify you in respect of certain requests, such as if you do not provide the requested information, we will still take certain actions as required by certain U.S. Privacy Laws. For example: If we cannot verify your deletion request, we will refer you to this U.S. State Privacy Notice for a general description of our data practices. If we cannot verify your specific pieces request, we will treat it as a categories request.BackgroundAuthorizing an AgentYou may designate an authorized agent to submit a request on your behalf by submitting a request in the manners described above. If you are an authorized agent who would like to make a request, the U.S. Privacy Laws require that we ensure that a request made by an agent is a Verifiable Consumer Request (except Do Not Sell/Share requests) and allow us to request further information to ensure that the Consumer has authorized you to make the request on their behalf. Generally, we will request that an agent provide proof that the Consumer gave the agent signed permission to submit the request, and, as permitted under the U.S. Privacy Laws, we also may require the Consumer to either verify their own identity or directly confirm with us that they provided the agent permission to submit the request.

Please note that personal data is retained by us for various time periods, so there may be certain information that we have collected about you that we do not even retain for 12 months (and thus, it would not be able to be included in our response to you). Please also note that you may be limited under your applicable state\u00e2\u0080\u0099s law to making a certain number of \u00e2\u0080\u009cright to know\u00e2\u0080\u009d requests in any 12-month period. BackgroundRight to DeleteIn addition, you have the right to request that we delete certain personal information we have collected from you. Please understand that P&G cannot delete personal data in those situations where our retention is required for our own internal business purposes or otherwise permitted by relevant U.S. Privacy Laws (such as fraud prevention or legal compliance). In these situations, we will retain your personal data in accordance with our records retention program and securely delete it at the end of the retention period.BackgroundRight to CorrectYou have the right to request that we correct inaccuracies that you find in your personal data maintained by us. Your request to correct is subject to our verification (discussed above) and the response standards in the applicable U.S. Privacy Laws.BackgroundRight to Limit Sensitive Personal Data ProcessingCertain personal data qualifies as \u00e2\u0080\u009csensitive personal data\u00e2\u0080\u009d or \u00e2\u0080\u009csensitive personal information\u00e2\u0080\u009d or \u00e2\u0080\u009cspecial category data\u00e2\u0080\u009d under U.S. Privacy Laws, which we refer to in this U.S. State Privacy Notice as \u00e2\u0080\u009csensitive personal data or special category data\u00e2\u0080\u009d. Some U.S Privacy Laws require consent for the processing of sensitive personal data or special category data, which can be revoked, subject to certain exceptions and exemptions (for example, if the processing of your sensitive personal data or special category data is required to provide a product or service specifically requested by you). Depending on your state of residence, you have the right to revoke such consent, if applicable, and/or direct businesses to limit their use and disclosure of sensitive personal data or special category data if they use or disclose it beyond certain internal business purposes. You can make a request using the methods set forth above.BackgroundRights as to Automated Decision-Making and ProfilingYou have the right to opt-out of profiling in furtherance of decisions that produce legal or similarly significant effects. However, as discussed above , we do not carry out profiling or automated decision-making activities in a manner that requires us to provide opt-out rights.BackgroundDo Not Sell/Share/TargetUnder the various U.S. Privacy Laws, Consumers have the right to opt-out of certain processing activities. Some states have opt-outs specific to Targeted Advertising activities - which California\u00e2\u0080\u0099s law refers to as \u00e2\u0080\u009ccross-context behavioral advertising\u00e2\u0080\u009d, and others simply as Targeted Advertising - which involve the use of personal data from different businesses or services to target advertisements to you. California provides Consumers the right to opt-out of Sharing, which includes providing or making available personal information to third parties for such Targeted Advertising activities, while other states provide Consumers the right to opt-out from processing personal information for Targeted Advertising more broadly. There are broad and differing concepts of the Sale of personal data under the various U.S. Privacy Laws, all of which at a minimum require providing or otherwise making available personal data to a third party. When you provide us personal data for the below Processing Purposes, we may use some or all of that personal data to advertise to you. This may include making available your personal data collected during these Processing Purposes to third parties in way that may constitute a Sale and/or Sharing, as well as using your personal data for purposes of Targeted Advertising.\u00e2\u0080\u00a2\tProducts/Services. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2\tCustomer Management.\u00e2\u0080\u00a2\tCustomer Service/Communications,\u00e2\u0080\u00a2\tServing Ads.\u00e2\u0080\u00a2\tAds Administration,\u00e2\u0080\u00a2\tPurposes Disclosed at CollectionThird-Party digital businesses, including online platforms (Google, Amazon, Facebook, etc.) and AdTech companies such as Demand Side Platforms which help us place advertisements (\u00e2\u0080\u009cThird-Party Digital Businesses\u00e2\u0080\u009d) may associate cookies and other tracking technologies that collect personal data about you on our apps and websites, or otherwise collect and process personal data that we make available about you, including digital activity information. Giving access to personal data on our websites or apps, or otherwise, to Third-Party Digital Businesses could be deemed a Sale and/or Sharing and could implicate processing for purposes of Targeted Advertising under some U.S. Privacy Laws. Therefore, we will treat such personal data collected by Third-Party Digital Businesses (e.g., cookie ID, IP address, and other online IDs and internet or other electronic activity information) as such, and subject to the opt-out requests described above. In some instances, the personal data we make available about you is collected directly by such Third-Party Digital Businesses using Tracking Technologies on our websites or apps, or our advertisements that are served on third-party sites (which we refer to as \u00e2\u0080\u009ccookie PI\u00e2\u0080\u009d). However, certain personal data which we make available to Third Party Digital Businesses is information that we have previously collected directly from you or otherwise about you, such as your email address (which we refer to below as \u00e2\u0080\u009cnon-cookie PI\u00e2\u0080\u009d). When you opt-out pursuant to the instructions below, it will have the effect of opting you out of Sale, Sharing, and Targeted Advertising, such that our opt-out process is intended to combine all of these state opt-outs into a single opt-out. Instructions for opting out are below. Please note that there are distinct instructions for opting out of cookie PI and non-cookie PI, which we explain further, below. Opt-out for non-cookie PI: If you would like to submit a request to opt-out of our processing of your non-cookie PI (e.g., your email address) for Targeted Advertising, or opt-out of the Sale or Sharing of such data, make an opt-out request here.Opt-out for cookie PI: If you would like to submit a request to opt-out of our processing of your cookie PI for Targeted Advertising or opt-out of the Sale/Sharing of such personal data, you need to exercise a separate opt-out request on our cookie management tool. To do so, click \u00e2\u0080\u009cDo Not Sell or Share My Personal Information / Opt-Out of Targeted Advertising\u00e2\u0080\u009d in the footer of each of our websites and/or in the Settings menu of each of our mobile applications.\u00c2\u00a0 Then follow the instructions for the toggle. This is because we have to use different technologies to apply your opt-outs of cookie PI and of non-cookie PI. Our cookie management tool enables you to exercise such an opt-out request and enable certain cookie preferences on your device.You must exercise your preferences separately on each of our websites that you visit, within each of our mobile applications that you use, if you use a different browser than the one on which you originally opted out, and on each device that you use. Since your browser opt-out is designated by a cookie, if you clear or block cookies, your preferences will no longer be affective, and you will need to enable them again via our cookie management tool.For more information about how we have shared your personal data with third parties such that it constitutes a \u00e2\u0080\u009cSale\u00e2\u0080\u009d or \u00e2\u0080\u009cShare\u00e2\u0080\u009d under CCPA during the 12-month period prior to the date this privacy policy was last updated, please refer to the chart above. We do not knowingly Sell or Share personal data of minors older than 13 years of age and under 16 years of age without their consent.BackgroundGlobal Privacy Control (\u00e2\u0080\u009cGPC\u00e2\u0080\u009d)Some of the U.S. Privacy Laws require businesses to process GPC signals, which is referred to in some states as opt-out preference signals and in other states as universal opt-out mechanisms. GPC is a signal sent by a platform, technology, or mechanism, enabled by individuals on their devices or browsers, that communicate the individual\u00e2\u0080\u0099s choice to opt-out of the Sale and Sharing of personal data, or of processing of personal data for Targeted Advertising. To use GPC, you can download an internet browser or a plugin to use on your current internet browser and follow the settings to enable the GPC. We have configured the settings of our consent management platform to receive and process GPC signals on our website and mobile applications, which is explained by our consent management platform here.Certain of the U.S. Privacy Laws require us to explain how we process GPC signals in detail, specifically how we apply GPC signals and the corresponding Do Not Sell/Share/Target requests to online data (what we refer to above as \u00e2\u0080\u009ccookie PI\u00e2\u0080\u009d) and offline data (what we refer to above as \u00e2\u0080\u009cnon-cookie PI\u00e2\u0080\u009d). Below we explain the scenarios in which we apply the Do Not Sell/Share/Target requests communicated by GPC signals to cookie PI and, where applicable, to non-cookie PI:\u00e2\u0080\u00a2\tWhen you are visiting our website on a particular internet browser (\u00e2\u0080\u009cbrowser 1\u00e2\u0080\u009d), we will apply the GPC signal and corresponding Do Not Sell/Share/Target to cookie PI collected on that browser 1. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2\tWhen you log in on browser 1: We will be able to apply the GPC signal and corresponding Do Not Sell/Share/Target request to non-cookie PI associated with your user account, but only if and after you have logged into your user account on browser 1.When you visit our website on a different browser (\u00e2\u0080\u009cbrowser 2\"). If you later visit our website on browser 2 (whether on the same device or a different device) and GPC is not enabled, we are unable to apply the prior GPC signal from browser 1 to cookie PI on browser 2, unless and until you login to your user account on browser 2. We will continue to apply the Do Not Sell/Share/Target opt-outs communicated via the GPC signal on browser 1.We process GPC signals in a frictionless manner, which means that we do not: (1) charge a fee for use of our service if you have enabled GPC; (2) change your experience with our website if you use GPC; or (3) display a notification, pop-up, text, graphic, animation, sound, video, or any interstitial in response to the GPC.BackgroundIncentive and Loyalty Programs; Right to Non-DiscriminationBackgroundLoyalty/Incentive Programs NoticeWe also collect and use your personal data to administer and maintain Rewards Programs (defined above in \u00e2\u0080\u009cHow We Gather & Use Personal Data\u00e2\u0080\u009d), which may be considered a \u00e2\u0080\u009cfinancial incentive\u00e2\u0080\u009d or a \u00e2\u0080\u009cbona fide loyalty program\u00e2\u0080\u009d under one or more of the U.S. Privacy Laws. We use all categories of personal data disclosed in the above table, excluding \u00e2\u0080\u009cbiometric information,\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cprofessional or employment information, and \u00e2\u0080\u009cnon-public education records,\u00e2\u0080\u009d to administer and maintain such Rewards Programs. All categories of personal data we use for loyalty programs may also be Sold or processed for Targeted Advertising. We may also use, Sell, and process for Targeted Advertising the categories of sensitive personal data or special category data: account information and credentials, precise geolocation data, racial or ethnic origin, and personal data concerning health. While we may collect sensitive personal data or special category data in relation to some Rewards Programs, the collection and processing of sensitive personal data or special category data is not required to participate in Rewards Programs. We use personal data to verify your identity, offer unique rewards, track your program status, and to facilitate the exchange of program points for products, promotional materials, training workshops, and other items. The categories of third parties that will receive personal data and sensitive personal data or special category data are set forth in the table above, some of which may qualify as data brokers under some of the U.S. Privacy Laws. Some U.S. Privacy Laws require us to state whether we provide Rewards Programs benefits through third-party partners; however, while we sometimes will provide you the opportunity to independently engage with third parties through our websites or apps, third parties do not provide Rewards Programs on our behalf.You can opt-in to a Rewards Program by signing up on the applicable rewards page. If you opt-in to participate in any of our Rewards Programs, you may withdraw from participation at any time by contacting us using the contact details in this Privacy Policy or in accordance with the instructions set forth in the applicable Rewards Program\u00e2\u0080\u0099s terms and conditions. Under certain U.S. Privacy Laws, you may be entitled to be informed as to why financial incentive programs, or price or service differences, are permitted under the law, including (i) a good-faith estimate of the value of your personal data that forms the basis for offering the financial incentive or price or service difference, and (ii) a description of the method we used to calculate the value of your personal data. Generally, we do not assign monetary or other value to personal data. However, in the event we are required by law to assign such value in the context of Rewards Programs, or price or service differences, we have valued the personal data collected and used as being equal to the value of the discount or benefit provided, and the calculation of the value is based upon a practical and good-faith effort often involving the (i) categories of personal data collected (e.g., names, email addresses), (ii) the use of such personal data for our marketing and business purposes in accordance with this Privacy Policy and our Rewards Programs, (iii) the discounted price offered (if any), (iv) the volume of consumers enrolled in our Rewards Programs, and (v) the product or service to which the Rewards Programs, or price or service differences, applies. The disclosure of the value described herein is not intended to waive, nor should be interpreted as a waiver to, our proprietary or business confidential information, including trade secrets, and does not constitute any representation with regard to generally accepted accounting principles or financial accounting standards. We deem the value of the personal data to be reasonably related to the value of the rewards, and by subscribing to these Rewards Programs you indicate you agree. If you do not, do not subscribe to the Rewards Programs. Non-DiscriminationYou have the right not to receive discriminatory treatment for the exercise of your privacy rights described in this U.S. State Privacy Notice. We will not deny, charge different prices for, or provide a different level or quality of goods or services in a manner that is prohibited by the U.S. Privacy Laws if you choose to exercise your rights. Please note, however, that you will no longer be able to participate in Rewards Programs request to delete personal data. This is because we need the personal data collected in relation Rewards Program to carry out the functions described above.BackgroundCalifornia Consumer Request MetricsClick\u00c2\u00a0here\u00c2\u00a0to see request metrics from the previous calendar year.BackgroundOther California NoticesBackgroundCalifornia Notice for MinorsWe may offer interactive services which allow teens under the age of 18 to upload their own content (e.g., videos, comments, status updates, or pictures).

Consumers may read our\u00a0Consumer Privacy Notice\u00a0for more information about their rights under US federal law. Understanding your choices You can control how Personal Information is collected or disclosed, as well as how we communicate with you. Here are some of the ways you can customize your choices. Choose how we collect Personal Information You may choose to limit the Personal Information you provide when our apps or Services request it. To help make choices that are right for you, it\u2019s important to understand that Personal Information helps us provide a richer, more personalized experience for you. Also, some Personal Information is required for our Services to function. For example, sharing your contacts helps make it easier for you to find the people you want to send money to. If you choose not to share your contacts with us, you can still use our mobile apps, but some actions may not be as fast or easy as it would be if you shared your contacts. Another example is creating an account or\u00a0Fastlane profile with us. If you choose not to provide information that is required for an account or\u00a0Fastlane profile to function, like your name and email address, we will not be able to create an account or\u00a0Fastlane profile for you. Choose how linked accounts collect and use Personal Information If you link your account to a third-party service, you may be able to manage how your Personal Information is collected, used, and shared by them. Read the third parties\u2019 privacy policies to see the choices they offer you. You can control which third-party services you link to your account and what Personal Information they can collect about you.

You may be able to adjust or turn off this setting in the Data and Privacy section in your account settings.Choose what we share with Partners and Merchants for Personalized ShoppingUnless we are required by law to obtain your consent, we share Personal Information collected after November 27, 2024 (or from earlier if you consent) for personalized shopping experiences.

We encourage you to read the privacy statements of other sites for assurance that their practices safeguard your privacy. European Union General Data Protection Regulation (EU GDPR) Privacy Notice Lawful Basis for Collecting and Processing of Personal Data GSU is an institute of higher education involved in education, research, and community engagement.\u00a0 In order for GSU to educate its students both in class and on-line, engage in world-class research, and provide community services, it is essential, necessary (and GSU has lawful bases) for GSU to collect, process, use, and maintain data of its students, employees, applicants, research subjects, and others involved in its educational, research, and community programs. The lawful bases include, without limitation, admission, registration, delivery of classroom, on-line, and study abroad education, grades, communications, employment, applied research, development, program analysis for improvements, and records retention. Examples of data that GSU may need to collect in connection with the lawful bases are: name, email address, IP address, physical address or other location identifier, photos, as well as some sensitive personal data obtained with prior consent. Most of GSU\u2019s collection and processing of personal data will fall under the following categories: Processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by GSU or third parties in providing education, employment, research and development, community programs. Processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party or in order to take steps at the request of the data subject prior to entering into a contract. This lawful basis pertains primarily but not exclusively to research contracts. Processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which GSU is subject. This lawful basis pertains primarily but not exclusively to compliance with state and federal laws. Examples are providing enrollment data to the U.S. Department of Education and providing employment and payroll data as required by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service. The data subject has given consent to the processing of his or her personal data for one or more specific purposes. This lawful basis pertains primarily but not exclusively to the protection of research subjects, providing medical and mental health services. There will be some instances where the collection and processing of personal data will be pursuant to other lawful bases. Types of Personal Data collected and why GSU collects a variety of personal and sensitive data to meet one of its lawful bases, as referenced above. Most often the data is used for academic admissions, enrollment, educational programs, job hiring, provision of medical services, participation in research, development and community outreach. Data typically includes name, address, transcripts, work history, information for payroll, research subject information, medical and health information (for student health services, or travel), and donations. If you have specific questions regarding the collection and use of your personal data, please contact the Office of Public Relations & Marketing Communications at [email\u00a0protected]. If a data subject refuses to provide personal data that is required by GSU in connection with one of GSU\u2019s lawful bases to collect such personal data, such refusal may make it impossible for GSU to provide education, employment, research or other requested services. Where GSU gets Personal and Sensitive Personal Data GSU receives personal and sensitive personal data from multiple sources. Most often, GSU gets this data directly from the data subject or under the direction of the data subject who has provided it to a third party (for example, application for admission to GSU through use of the Common App). Individual Rights of the Data Subject under the EU GDPR Individual data subjects covered by GSU\u2019s EU General Data Protection Regulation Compliance will be afforded the following rights: information about the controller collecting the data the data protection officer contact information the purposes and legal basis/legitimate interests of the data collection/processing recipients of the personal data if GSU intends to transfer personal data to another country or international organization the period the personal data will be stored the existence of the right to access, rectify incorrect data or erase personal data, restrict or object to processing, and the right to data portability the existence of the right to withdraw consent at any time the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority (established in the EU) why the personal data are required, and possible consequences of the failure to provide the data the existence of automated decision-making, including profiling if the collected data are going to be further processed for a purpose other than that for which it was collected Any data subject who wishes to exercise any of the above-mentioned rights may do so by filling such request with the Office of Public Relations and Marketing Communication at\u00a0at [email\u00a0protected]. Security of Personal Data subject to the EU GDPR All personal data and sensitive personal data collected or processed by GSU under the scope of the GSU EU General Data Protection Regulation Compliance must comply with the security controls and systems and process requirements and standards of GSU policies. We will not share your information with third parties except: as necessary to meet one of its lawful purposes, including\u00a0 but not limited to, its legitimate interest, contract compliance, pursuant to consent provided by you, as required by law; as necessary to protect GSU\u2019s interests; with service providers acting on our behalf who have agreed to protect the confidentiality of the data. Data Retention GSU keeps the data it collects for the time periods specified in the University System of Georgia Records Retention Schedules: https://www.usg.edu/records_management/schedules/ For examples of Student Records Retention Schedules, see: https://www.usg.edu/records_management/schedules/934 For examples of Human Resources (Employment) Records Retention Schedules, see: https://www.usg.edu/records_management/schedules/930 Data Subject Requests (DSR) Individuals, in their capacity as \u201cdata subjects,\u201d have the right to make requests to review the personal data that GSU has collected about them.\u00a0 A data subject request (DSR) is a request from an individual to GSU asking for their personal data held by GSU.\u00a0 GSU has created a DSR process and workflow to facilitate such requests.\u00a0 To request your information via a DSR, please use the link below to complete the form: Data Subject Request Form",
